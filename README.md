𝙏𝙤𝙥 𝙄𝙣𝙨𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩𝙨; 📈
The main insights of this project is to find that the Profit Margin was too low and decreasing year to year and the company has to manage this. The Profit Margin low and company wasn’t generating anything and losing money day by day.


𝙏𝙤𝙥 𝙍𝙚𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙙𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨: 😍

The main focus should be on Profit Margin, because that is decreasing year by year despite of the fact that the sale is increasing. So to get rid of the this loss, we have to focus on those products that are making high and high profit margin. Our top selling products are not making much profit margins, we have to push the customers to buy the products with high profit margin.
